# Gradient-Boosting-Regressor---Step-by-Step-Implementation
This project demonstrates a step-by-step implementation of the **Gradient Boosting Regressor** from scratch using a simple quadratic dataset. It helps visualize how boosting works by sequentially reducing residual errors using decision tree regressors.
